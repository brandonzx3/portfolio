                <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                    I'm brandonzx3 and I started programming in 2016 and started off by making unity games. I developed games in unity from then until 2017.
                    In 2017 I started learning web development. I worked on websites and apps with no real purpose until wchool started in 2018.
                    In school I met a friend who tought me more in depth web development and Javascript. We would go on to work on projects together and still work
                    and collaborate with each other. He gave me one of the first insporations for one of my first truly complete project to remake his schedule app
                    for school which is now hosted <a href="https://bbchs.brandonzx3.dev">Here</a>. That same year i joined robotics at my school and had the best 4
                    years of my life. during highschool i would learn java, kotlin, rust, nodejs, VB, php, and lua. Now its 2022 I'm graduated from highschool and
                    going to collage to study computer science.

                    <p>Robitics has been a passion of mine since I was a kid. In high school I joind FRC team 5848 Ironclad and became the lead programmer.</p>
                    <p>In Ironclad I learned how to program in Labview and work directly with hardware.</p>
                    <p>I've also worked with personal proects using Arduino and Raspbrry PI.</p>
